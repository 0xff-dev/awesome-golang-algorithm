# [1624.Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters][title]

## Description
Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
```
