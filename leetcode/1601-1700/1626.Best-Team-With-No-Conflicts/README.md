# [1626.Best Team With No Conflicts][title]

## Description
You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the **sum** of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have **conflicts**. A **conflict** exists if a younger player has a **strictly higher** score than an older player. A conflict does **not** occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the i<sup>th</sup> player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 34
Explanation: You can choose all the players.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 16
Explanation: It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: scores = [1,2,3,5], ages = [8,9,10,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is best to choose the first 3 players.
```
