# [1653.Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced][title]

## Description
You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`.

You can delete any number of characters in `s` to make `s` **balanced**. `s` is **balanced** if there is no pair of indices `(i,j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] = 'b'` and `s[j]= 'a'`.

Return the **minimum** number of deletions needed to make `s` **balanced**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
```
