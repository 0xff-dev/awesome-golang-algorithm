# [1615.Maximal Network Rank][title]

## Description
There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub>.

The **network rank** of **two different cities** is defined as the total number of **directly** connected roads to **either** city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted **once**.

The **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure is the **maximum network rank** of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return the **maximal network rank of the entire infrastructure.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 8, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be connected.
```
