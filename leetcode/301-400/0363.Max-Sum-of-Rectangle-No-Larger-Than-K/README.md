# [363.Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K][title]

## Description
Given an `m x n` matrix `matrix` and an integer `k`, return the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than `k`.

It is **guaranteed** that there will be a rectangle with a sum no larger than `k`.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./sum-grid.jpeg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the sum of the blue rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2, and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[2,2,-1]], k = 3
Output: 3
```
