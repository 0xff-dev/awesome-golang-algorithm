# [313.Super Ugly Number][title]

## Description
A **super ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array `primes`.

Given an integer `n` and an array of integers `primes`, return the n<sup>th</sup> **super ugly number**.

The n<sup>th</sup> **super ugly number** is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
Output: 32
Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, primes = [2,3,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are in the array primes = [2,3,5].
```
