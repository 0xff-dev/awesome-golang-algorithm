# [395.Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters][title]

## Description
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring of `s` such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to `k`.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```
