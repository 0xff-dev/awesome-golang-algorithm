# [306.Additive Number][title]

## Description
An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note**: Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "112358"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
```

**Except 2:**

```
Input: "199100199"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
```
