# [3005.Count Elements With Maximum Frequency][title]

## Description
You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Return the **total frequencies** of elements in `nums` such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency.

The **frequency** of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
```
