# [3070.Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

Return the **number** of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the `grid`, and have a sum less than or equal to `k`.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
Output: 4
Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.png)

```
Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.
```
