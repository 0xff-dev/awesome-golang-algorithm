# [986.Interval List Intersections][title]

## Description
You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and `secondList[j] = [startj, endj]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise **disjoint** and in **sorted order**.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.png)

```
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []
```
