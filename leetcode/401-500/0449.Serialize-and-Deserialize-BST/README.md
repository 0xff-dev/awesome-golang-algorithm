# [449.Serialize and Deserialize BST][title]

## Description
Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
