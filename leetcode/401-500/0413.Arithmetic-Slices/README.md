# [413.Arithmetic Slices][title]

## Description
An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

- For example, `[1,3,5,7,9]`, `[7,7,7,7]`, and `[3,-1,-5,-9]` are arithmetic sequences.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of arithmetic **subarrays** of `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0
```
