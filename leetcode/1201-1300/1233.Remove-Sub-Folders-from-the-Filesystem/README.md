# [1233.Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem][title]

## Description
Given a list of folders `folder`, return the folders after removing all **sub-folders** in those folders. You may return the answer in **any order**.

If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a **sub-folder** of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `'/'` followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

0 For example, `"/leetcode"` and `"/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string and `"/"` are not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
```
