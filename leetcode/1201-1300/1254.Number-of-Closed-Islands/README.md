# [1254.Number of Closed Islands][title]

## Description
Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island **totally** (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s`.

Return the number of closed islands.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./sample_3_1610.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./sample_4_1610.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
```
