# [1089.Duplicate Zeros][title]

## Description
Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

**EXample 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```
