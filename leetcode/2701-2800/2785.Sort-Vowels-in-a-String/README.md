# [2785. Sort Vowels in a String][title]

## Description
Given a **0-indexed** string `s`, **permute** `s` to get a new string `t` such that:

- All consonants remain in their original places. More formally, if there is an index `i` with `0 <= i < s.length` such that `s[i]` is a consonant, then `t[i] = s[i]`.
- The vowels must be sorted in the **nondecreasing** order of their **ASCII** values. More formally, for pairs of indices `i`, `j` with `0 <= i < j < s.length` such that `s[i]` and `s[j]` are vowels, then `t[i]` must not have a higher ASCII value than `t[j]`.

Return the resulting string.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`, and they can appear in lowercase or uppercase. Consonants comprise all letters that are not vowels.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "lEetcOde"
Output: "lEOtcede"
Explanation: 'E', 'O', and 'e' are the vowels in s; 'l', 't', 'c', and 'd' are all consonants. The vowels are sorted according to their ASCII values, and the consonants remain in the same places.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "lYmpH"
Output: "lYmpH"
Explanation: There are no vowels in s (all characters in s are consonants), so we return "lYmpH".
```
