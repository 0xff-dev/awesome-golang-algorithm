# [3115.Maximum Prime Difference][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return an integer that is the **maximum** distance between the **indices** of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers in `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,9,5,3]

Output: 3

Explanation: nums[1], nums[3], and nums[4] are prime. So the answer is |4 - 1| = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,8,2,8]

Output: 0

Explanation: nums[2] is prime. Because there is just one prime number, the answer is |2 - 2| = 0.
```
