# [2405.Optimal Partition of String][title]

## Description
Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition.

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
```
