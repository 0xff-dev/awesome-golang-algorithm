# [274.H-Index][title]

## Description
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their i<sup>th</sup> paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```
