# [1436. Destination City][title]

## Description
You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityAi` to `cityBi`. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are: 
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"C" -> "A". 
"A". 
Clearly the destination city is "A".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
Output: "Z"
```
