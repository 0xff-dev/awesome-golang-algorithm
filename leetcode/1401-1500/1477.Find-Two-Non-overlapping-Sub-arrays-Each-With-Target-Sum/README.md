# [1001.Grid Illumination][title]

## Description
You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
```
