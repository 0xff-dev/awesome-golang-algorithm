# [1001.Grid Illumination][title]

## Description
Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (`0, 0`) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `true` if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123929-pm.png)

```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)

```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```
