# [1347.Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram][title]

## Description
You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose **any character** of `t` and replace it with **another character**.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An **Anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.
```
