# [1190.Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses][title]

## Description
You are given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.

Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.

Your result should **not** contain any brackets.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "(abcd)"
Output: "dcba"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "(u(love)i)"
Output: "iloveu"
Explanation: The substring "love" is reversed first, then the whole string is reversed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: First, we reverse the substring "oc", then "etco", and finally, the whole string.
```
