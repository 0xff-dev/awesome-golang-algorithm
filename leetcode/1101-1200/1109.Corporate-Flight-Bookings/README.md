You are given an array of flight bookings `bookings`, where `bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi]` represents a booking for flights first<sub>i</sub> through last<sub>i</sub> (**inclusive**) with seats<sub>i</sub> seats reserved for **each flight** in the range.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the total number of seats reserved for flight `i`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
