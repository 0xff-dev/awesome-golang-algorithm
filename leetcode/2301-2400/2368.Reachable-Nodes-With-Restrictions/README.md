# [2368.Reachable Nodes With Restrictions][title]

## Description
There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. You are also given an integer array `restricted` which represents **restricted** nodes.

Return the **maximum** number of nodes you can reach from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.

Note that node `0` will **not** be a restricted node.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,5],[0,4],[3,2],[6,5]], restricted = [4,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
We have that [0,5,6] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
```
