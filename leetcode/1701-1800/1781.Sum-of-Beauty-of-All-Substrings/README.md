# [1781.Sum of Beauty of All Substrings][title]

## Description
The **beauty** of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

- For example, the beauty of `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Given a string `s`, return the sum of **beauty** of all of its substrings.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aabcb"
Output: 5

```
