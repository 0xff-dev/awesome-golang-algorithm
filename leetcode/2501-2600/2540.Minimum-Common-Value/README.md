# [2540.Minimum Common Value][title]

## Description
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the **minimum integer common** to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`.

Note that an integer is said to be **common** to `nums1` and `nums2` if both arrays have **at least one** occurrence of that integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.
```
