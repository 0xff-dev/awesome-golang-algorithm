# [2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

- The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.
- Each integer can be chosen **at most once*8.
- The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.
- The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.

Return the **maximum** number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: banned = [1,6,5], n = 5, maxSum = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: You can choose the integers 2 and 4.
2 and 4 are from the range [1, 5], both did not appear in banned, and their sum is 6, which did not exceed maxSum.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: banned = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], n = 8, maxSum = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot choose any integer while following the mentioned conditions.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: banned = [11], n = 7, maxSum = 50
Output: 7
Explanation: You can choose the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
They are from the range [1, 7], all did not appear in banned, and their sum is 28, which did not exceed maxSum.
```
