# [164. Maximum Gap][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two elements, return `0`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.
```
