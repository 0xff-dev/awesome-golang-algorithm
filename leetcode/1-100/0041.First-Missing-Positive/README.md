# [41.First Missing Positive][title]

## Description
Given an unsorted integer array `nums`. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in `nums`.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` auxiliary space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
```
