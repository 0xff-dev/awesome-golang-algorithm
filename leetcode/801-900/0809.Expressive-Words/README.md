# [809.Expressive Words][title]

## Description
Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example:

- `"hello" -> "heeellooo"`
- `"hi" -> "hiiii"`

In these strings like `"heeellooo"`, we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: `"h"`, `"eee"`, `"ll"`, `"ooo"`.

You are given a string `s` and an array of query strings `words`. A query word is **strectchy** if it can be made to be equal to `s` by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters `c`, and add some number of characters `c` to the group so that the size of the group is **three or more**.

- For example, starting with `"hello"`, we could do an extension on the group `"o"` to get `"hellooo"`, but we cannot get `"helloo"` since the group `"oo"` has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like `"ll" -> "lllll"` to get `"helllllooo"`. If `s = "helllllooo"`, then the query word `"hello"` would be **strectchy** because of these two extension operations: `query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = s`.

Return the number of query strings that are **strectchy**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "heeellooo", words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "zzzzzyyyyy", words = ["zzyy","zy","zyy"]
Output: 3
```
