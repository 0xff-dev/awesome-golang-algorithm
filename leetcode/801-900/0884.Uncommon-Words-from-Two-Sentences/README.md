# [884.Uncommon Words from Two Sentences][title]

## Description
A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is **uncommon** if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and **does not appear** in the other sentence.

Given two **sentences** `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the **uncommon words**. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"

Output: ["sweet","sour"]

Explanation:

The word "sweet" appears only in s1, while the word "sour" appears only in s2.
```

**Example 2:**

Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
