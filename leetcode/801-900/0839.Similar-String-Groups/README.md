# [893.Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings][title]

## Description
Two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of `X`, so that it equals `Y`. Also two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if they are equal.

For example, `"tars"` and `"rats"` are similar (swapping at positions `0` and `2`), and `"rats"` and `"arts"` are similar, but `"star"` is not similar to `"tars"`, `"rats"`, or `"arts"`.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: `{"tars", "rats", "arts"}` and `{"star"}`.  Notice that `"tars"` and `"arts"` are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list `strs` of strings where every string in `strs` is an anagram of every other string in `strs`. How many groups are there?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1
```
