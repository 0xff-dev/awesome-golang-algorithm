# [846.Hand of Straights][title]

## Description
Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the i<sup>th</sup> card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.
```
