# [2261.K Divisible Elements Subarrays][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`, return the number of **distinct subarrays**, which have **at most** `k` elements that are divisible by `p`.

Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are said to be **distinct** if:

- They are of **different** lengths, or
- There exists **at least** one index `i` where `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

A **subarray** is defined as a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2], k = 2, p = 2
Output: 11
Explanation:
The elements at indices 0, 3, and 4 are divisible by p = 2.
The 11 distinct subarrays which have at most k = 2 elements divisible by 2 are:
[2], [2,3], [2,3,3], [2,3,3,2], [3], [3,3], [3,3,2], [3,3,2,2], [3,2], [3,2,2], and [2,2].
Note that the subarrays [2] and [3] occur more than once in nums, but they should each be counted only once.
The subarray [2,3,3,2,2] should not be counted because it has 3 elements that are divisible by 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 4, p = 1
Output: 10
Explanation:
All element of nums are divisible by p = 1.
Also, every subarray of nums will have at most 4 elements that are divisible by 1.
Since all subarrays are distinct, the total number of subarrays satisfying all the constraints is 10.
```
