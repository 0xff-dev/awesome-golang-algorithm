# [624.Maximum Distance in Arrays][title]

## Description
You are given `m` `arrays`, where each array is sorted in **ascending order**.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integers `a` and `b` to be their absolute difference `|a - b|`.

Return the maximum distance.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arrays = [[1],[1]]
Output: 0
```
