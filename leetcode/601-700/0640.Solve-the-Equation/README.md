# [640.Solve the Equation][title]

## Description
Solve a given equation and return the value of `'x'` in the form of a string `"x=#value"`. The equation contains only `'+'`, `'-'` operation, the variable `'x'` and its coefficient. You should return `"No solution"` if there is no solution for the equation, or `"Infinite solutions"` if there are infinite solutions for the equation.

If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of `'x'` is an integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: equation = "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
Output: "x=2"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: equation = "x=x"
Output: "Infinite solutions"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: equation = "2x=x"
Output: "x=0"
```
