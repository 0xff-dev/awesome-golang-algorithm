# [689.Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find three non-overlapping subarrays of length `k` with maximum sum and return them.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (**0-indexed**). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], k = 2
Output: [0,3,5]
Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
```

**EXample 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1], k = 2
Output: [0,2,4]
```
