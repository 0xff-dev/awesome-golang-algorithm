# [541.Reverse String II][title]

## Description
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
```
