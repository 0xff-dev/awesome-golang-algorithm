# [508.Most Frequent Subtree Sum][title]

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the most frequent **subtree sum**. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

The **subtree sum** of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).

**Example 1:**  

![example](./freq1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,2,-3]
Output: [2,-3,4]
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./freq2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,2,-5]
Output: [2]
```
